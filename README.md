## Hello Raspberry Pi Zero
1. Lessons learned
   We learned what a Raspberry Pi actually was and all that it is able to do. The set up was really cool and intricate. Once we got the pi workin gwe had to set up our own files. This required programming with commands we were not used to. The biggest hurdle was the new commands or language that we are using. 
## Hello Mathematica
1. Lessons Learned
   We learned that there are other ways to create a calculator by coding it on a computer. We learned the basic functions of the calculator and what each command does. We also learned how to create charts and graphs in teh program and how to integrate more complex math into them. Our biggest hurdle was figuring out how to make a sin function with an animation to alter the variables.

## Hello Python
1. Lessons learned
   We got more familiar with the language of python. After practicing with hello world we then made an automatic dice roller. The hardest part was getting the repitition of a random number between 1 and 6. We learned how to use while loops to fix this issue.

## Python Program Calculator
1. Lessons Learned
   We learned how to calculate simple math problems in Python. We had previously learned this in arduino, but we encounterd problems with learning the new language. However the code was fairly simple once we figured out the commands we needed to do each funcion when we entered two numbers.

## Python Program Quadratic Solver
1. Lessons learned
   We first decided that we needed to define three variables. We came to a standstill when we needed to write the quadratic formula. After some research we leanred the commands doQuad and myArray. These two commands helped to simplify our code. By using the discriminant we were able to eliminate the equations with no real roots. Then by using myArray we created two strings that allowed us to insert and calcualte the real roots.

## Hello Git
1. Lessons learned
   We learned how to use github and push information from out pi to the website. 
## Git Forks and Clones
1. Lessons learned
   We used the information and commands we had learned from hello git, however we made this assignment more complicated than what we ended up having to do. We struggled with forking our own branch from the main page. We tried to edit it through github instead of through the terminal, which we realized was not the ideal way. After taking a step back, we made the changes necessary to add our information to the cool repo page after pushing it from our terminal.
