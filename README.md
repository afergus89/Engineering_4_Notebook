## Hello Raspberry Pi Zero
1. Lessons learned

   We learned what a Raspberry Pi actually was and all that it is able to do. The set up was really cool and intricate. Once we got the pi workin gwe had to set up our own files. This required programming with commands we were not used to. The biggest hurdle was the new commands or language that we are using. 
   
## Hello Mathematica
1. Lessons Learned

   We learned that there are other ways to create a calculator by coding it on a computer. We learned the basic functions of the calculator and what each command does. We also learned how to create charts and graphs in teh program and how to integrate more complex math into them. Our biggest hurdle was figuring out how to make a sin function with an animation to alter the variables.

## Hello Python
1. Lessons learned

   We got more familiar with the language of python. After practicing with hello world we then made an automatic dice roller. The hardest part was getting the repitition of a random number between 1 and 6. We learned how to use while loops to fix this issue.

## Python Program Calculator
1. Lessons Learned

   We learned how to calculate simple math problems in Python. We had previously learned this in arduino, but we encounterd problems with learning the new language. However the code was fairly simple once we figured out the commands we needed to do each funcion when we entered two numbers.

## Python Program Quadratic Solver
1. Lessons learned

   We first decided that we needed to define three variables. We came to a standstill when we needed to write the quadratic formula. After some research we leanred the commands doQuad and myArray. These two commands helped to simplify our code. By using the discriminant we were able to eliminate the equations with no real roots. Then by using myArray we created two strings that allowed us to insert and calcualte the real roots.

## Hello Git
1. Lessons learned

   We learned how to use github and push information from out pi to the website. 
   
## Git Forks and Clones
1. Lessons learned

   We used the information and commands we had learned from hello git, however we made this assignment more complicated than what we ended up having to do. We struggled with forking our own branch from the main page. We tried to edit it through github instead of through the terminal, which we realized was not the ideal way. After taking a step back, we made the changes necessary to add our information to the cool repo page after pushing it from our terminal. 

## Python Strings and Loops
1. Lessons learned

	We learned about the split function, but ended up not using it and wrote the minimal amount of code that we could to complte the assignment.

## MSP
1. Lessons learned

  We learned what an array is and how to use it. We had several differnet arrays in this assignment and learned how to use them simultaneously. The hardest part was getting the guessed letters into the correct spaces in the word. We found that using an array solved that problem.

## GPIO pins- Bash
1. Lessons learned

  This was our first time using GPIO pins and we learned the correct commands for turning an LED on and off 10 consecutive times through Python. 

2. Code

  [Bash](Python/GPIOpins.py)

## GPIO pins- SSH

1. Lessons learned

  We connected our pi to the Wi-Fi and once it was online we figured the pi has its own IP address. We were able to connect to the IP address through our phone. Once pYthon was opened on the phone we were able to turn the LEDs on and off remotely. 

2. Code
  
  We did this through an app on Alex's phone

## Hello Flask

1. Lessons learned

  We learned how to make a web page for our pi. This took the previous assignment up a notch and we were able to see and access our pi through an IP address. 
 
2. Code

  [Flask](Python/Flask/Hello_World/app.py)

## GPIO Pins- Flask

1. Lessons learned

  We learned how to code/make an html website. We already we able to turn the LEDs on through the IP address, but we struggled toggling them. We had to learn how to write html code and teh specific format of it. In the process of writing the code we learned how to enable the computer to recognize different request forms. In doing so, this allowed us to simplify our code and just use if statements.

## GPIO- I2C

1. Lessons learned

   We were introduced to an accelerometer and an OLED display. We learned how to enable I2C on our pi. We were given previously written coding templated that we used to help us understand how they work together. First we made shapes on our display and then we were able to take those measurements and display them on the OLED screen.
